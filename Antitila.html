		<h2>About the band - Antitila</h2>
		<p>Antitila is one of the most famous Ukrainian pop-rock bands, which in ten years of its existence released six studio albums and covered the way from small concert halls to multi-thousand stadiums.
			<br> Antitila owe their name to the song of the same name, which frontman Taras Topolya performed in one of the Kyiv clubs in 2004. The composition tells about opposites that are very different, but cannot do without each other. The philosophical subtext of the song became defining for the team and was firmly established in the name of the band.</p>

The team did not win the show, but received much more - the love of fans and the opportunity to conquer the big stage. In the same year, the guys went on their debut open-air tour of the cities of Ukraine and debuted with concerts in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Uman, Sumy and Cherkasy.
